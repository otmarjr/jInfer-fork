ISO Schematron is the result of enhancing Schematron, the leading assertion language, with improvements gleaned from other, subsequent similar languages and from multiple developers on all the most important modern platforms, and from almost five years of use. Schematron is mature, well-respected, widely implemented, well thought out, and, most importantly, small enough to be convenient. In 2007, please consider adopt ISO Schematron, rather than rolling your own home-made or proprietary language. Members of standards committees evaluating Schematron-like alternatives may appreciate that ISO Schematron is a framework that allows use of other domain-specific languages in place of the default XPaths.}},
