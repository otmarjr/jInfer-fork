	<h1>Module Developer's Tutorial</h1>

        <p>
          Target audience: jInfer module developers. Anyone who needs to extend jInfer capabilities by writing a new module.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="prerequisities">
            This tutorial assumes that you are a seasoned Java developer. Having experience with programming in some kind of framework (NetBeans Platform above all) will help you a lot.<br/>
            Make sure you have read the articles on architecture, data structures and inference process to understand what you will be implementing.<br/>
            Also, before starting this tutorial, make sure you can <a href="building_jinfer.html">build jInfer from sources</a>.
          </span>
        </p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
  <ol type=1>
    <li>Get NetBeans, jInfer sources, try a build.</li>
    <li>Decide on the type of module you want to create.</li>
    <li>Create new NetBeans module.</li>
    <li>Implement jInfer-specific interfaces.</li>
    <li>Implement your logic.</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Building jInfer from sources</h2>
  <p>
    Refer to the <a href="building_jinfer.html">official instructions</a>.
  </p>
  
<h2>What type of module?</h2>
  <p>
    First thing you need to realize is what kind of module you will be
    implementing. Is it going to be a part of the inference? If yes, what stage?
    Importing the initial grammar? Simplifying it? Exporting to resulting schema?
    If you are not sure what these terms mean, go read the articles on interence process again.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your logic doesn't belong to the inference process, it might just extend
    one of the existing modules. Try looking for the code you would like to change.
  </p>

<h2>New NetBeans module</h2>
<p>
  <span class="prerequisities">This section assumes you have successfully imported jInfer in NetBeans.</span>
</p>
<ol type=1>
  <li>Expand the jInfer suite (brown puzzles icon).</li>
  <li>Right-click <i>Modules</i>, select <i>Add New...</i>.</li>
  <li>On the first page, pick a name for your module. Click <i>Next</i>.</li>
  <li>On the second page, fill out the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Code base</i>: this will be the package structure in which your code is placed.
        If you want, follow our convention: <code>cz.cuni.mff.ksi.jinfer.<i>yourmodule</i></code>.
        Otherwise choose something like <code><i>tld.company.jinfer.yourmodule</i></code>.
      </li>
      <li><i>Module display name</i>: pretty obvious.</li>
      <li><i>Generate XML layer</i>: you may want to check this option, but it doesn't really matter at this stage.</li>
    </ul>
    Rest of the options is uninteresting in most cases.
  </li>
  <li>Click <i>Finish</i>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Dealing with jInfer and NetBeans Platform</h2>

This section deals with a few important but pretty specific parts of interface
between your module (or any logic you implement) and either jInfer or NetBeans
Platform. Not nearly everything regarding interaction with NBP is mentioned here,
please refer to the relevant FAQ.
