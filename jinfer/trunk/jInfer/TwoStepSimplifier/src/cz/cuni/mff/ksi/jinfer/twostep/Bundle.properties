OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=jInfer
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Two step, strongly modular implementation of a simplifier: element clustering is followed by regular expression inference. \n\
    Clustering by element name is implemented, advanced methods (context, content, tree distance) are possible.\n\
    Regular expression inference using a merging state algorithm with k,h-context equivalency and state removal method are implemented, almost infinite possibilities of extension are available.
