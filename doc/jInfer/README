If you want to edit architecture, go to architecture/architecture.tex. Use make to build .pdf, on ubuntu install tex-gyre, cm-super, cm-super-x11, graphviz packages if something doesn't work. (and latex of course).

If you want to start writing new documentation pdf, copy architecture.tex and Makefile into new subdirectory, read makefile to find .eps files line and change it accordingly. Also all: target needs change.

Open doc/jInfer/Makefile and add yout subfolder to the targets!
You must name your xxx.tex with same name as directory:
bubu/bubu.tex CORRECT
bubu/mydoc.tex WRONG
thanx

Package names like \code{cz.cuni.mff.ksi.jinfer.base.interfaces.objects} are hyphenated automatically on . positions.
If you need to help latex in hypenation either, use \. on place, where he can hypenate:
\code{cz.cu\.ni.mff.ksi.j\.in\.fer.ba\.se.in\.ter\.fa\.ces.ob\.ject}
constant names are not done automatically:
\code{CAN\_HANDLE\_COMPLEX\_REGEXPS} will probably fail. Give latex hint by
\code{CAN\_\.HANDE\_\.COMPLEX\_\.REGEXPS}. You may use \. in text too. But for text use, there is latex's default \-, it hy-
phens words by inserting - sign. (\. inserts nothing).

To produce nice images, use graphviz by copy&paste from *.gv files in architecture/. Note the fontname setting!
To use Computer Modern Typewriter in graphviz, font name is SFTT1000.

For other images, openoffice.org draw can be used succesfuly (see figure 8: Runner in architecture.pdf that the results are NICE).
In openoffice, you can! (and should) use TeXGyrePagella font for text (package tex-gyre).
For code (as in fig runner) you should use Computer Modern Typewriter, which you get in cm-super-[x11].
To hack openoffice to use it, use .fonts.conf committed here (named _fonts.conf), copy it to ~/.fonts.conf and run
$ fc-cache -f
reopen OOo, and voila.
In OOo draw, there is 'connector' arrow type which uses ports on rectangles to connect nicely.

For images, we prefer round boxes in general. For interfaces however, use rectangles, for classes use rounded rectangles.
For UML-like diagram see figure 4 (XML represetenging interfaces and classes in detail) in architecture.pdf, source file is nodes_full2.gv.
GFraphiv html-like labels are used, see:
http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html

For all other stuff, copy paste architecture.tex or simply ask :)
