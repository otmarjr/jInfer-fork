OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=jInfer
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Simplifier works in two steps:\n1. \
    Cluster elements - We provide clustering by element name. \
    Advanced (context, content, tree distance) can be implemented.\n2. \
    Infer regular expression for each element. \
    We provide merging state algorithm with k,h-context equivalency and state removal method for converting automaton to regular expression.\n\
    The result may be cleaned to tweak common regular expression shorthands: a,a* to a+; a, (a, a) to (a, a, a) etc.

OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=Two step: 1. Cluster elements 2. Find regular expression for each element
