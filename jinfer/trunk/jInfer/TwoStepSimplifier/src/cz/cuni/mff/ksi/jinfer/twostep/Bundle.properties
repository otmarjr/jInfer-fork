OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Simplifier works in two steps:\n1. \
    Cluster elements - each cluster contains element instances that are believed to be instances of same element. \
    We are providing clustering by element name, but advanced clusterers (by name and context, and content, using tree distance etc) may be implemented.\n2. \
    Find regular expression for each element. \
    We provide implementation of merging state algorithm. \
    States are considered equivalent based on k,h-context property:\n    k preceeding transitions of two states are same -> states are equivalent, and also h preceeding states are considered equivalent.\n\n\
    The result may be passed to cleaner submodules to tweak common regular expression shorthands: a,a* change to a+; a, (a, a) change to (a, a, a) etc.
