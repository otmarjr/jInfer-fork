TODO talk about FIDAX
To the best of our knowledge, there are no other articles dealing with this problem.

TODO talk about Fajt - but that's different, that's keys
TODO add citation for Fajt

\section{Independent Set}

TODO define IS + MIS rigorously

TODO other approaches to max IS

\section{Linear Programming}

TODO define LP rigorously

TODO set of variables, constraints (often implicitly $x_i > 0$) and objective function, target is to maximize or minimize while observing the constraints.

TODO this is simple using Simplex method, however gets hard as soon as we require some of the variables to be integral or boolean.
